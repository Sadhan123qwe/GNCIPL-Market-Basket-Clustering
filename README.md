# GNCIPL-Market-Basket-Clustering



### Option 1: Quick & Concise

**Market Basket Analysis with Clustering**

This project uses unsupervised machine learning to perform market basket analysis. By applying clustering algorithms like K-Means to transactional data, we identify distinct customer purchasing patterns and segment customers based on their buying behavior. This helps in targeted marketing, product recommendations, and store layout optimization.

**Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

### Option 2: Standard Description (Recommended)

# Market Basket Clustering & Customer Segmentation ðŸ›’ðŸ¤–

This repository contains a Python project for performing **Market Basket Analysis** using clustering algorithms. The goal is to analyze customer transaction data to discover hidden patterns and segment customers into meaningful groups based on their purchasing habits.

This approach moves beyond traditional association rules (like Apriori) to provide a more holistic view of customer personas. By understanding these segments, businesses can create targeted marketing campaigns, personalized recommendations, and smarter inventory management strategies.

## \#\# Key Features

  * **Data Preprocessing:** Scripts for cleaning and transforming raw transactional data into a usable format.
  * **Feature Engineering:** Creation of a customer-item matrix to represent purchasing behavior.
  * **Clustering Models:** Implementation of K-Means and DBSCAN to identify distinct customer segments.
  * **Optimal Cluster Selection:** Use of the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score to determine the ideal number of clusters.
  * **Visualization:** Jupyter notebooks with visualizations (using Matplotlib & Seaborn) to interpret and analyze the resulting clusters.

### Option 3: More Detailed & Professional

# Advanced Market Basket Analysis via Unsupervised Clustering

This project provides a comprehensive framework for customer segmentation using clustering techniques on retail transaction data. Instead of relying solely on frequent itemsets, this analysis clusters customers themselves, revealing underlying behavioral archetypes.

The core idea is to transform transactional data into a customer feature space and apply algorithms like **K-Means** to group similar customers. The resulting segments can be profiled to understand "who" the customers are in each group (e.g., "bulk buyers," "weekend shoppers," "essentials-only purchasers").

-----

## \#\# Project Workflow

1.  **Data Ingestion & Cleaning:** Loading raw sales data and handling missing values, duplicates, and data type conversions.
2.  **Feature Engineering:** Pivoting the data to create a binary matrix where rows represent customers and columns represent products, indicating whether a customer purchased a product.
3.  **Dimensionality Reduction (Optional):** Applying techniques like PCA to reduce the feature space for more efficient clustering.
4.  **Model Training:**
      * Determining the optimal number of clusters ($k$) using the Elbow Method and Silhouette Analysis.
      * Training a K-Means clustering model on the prepared data.
5.  **Cluster Profiling & Interpretation:** Analyzing the product preferences and purchasing statistics for each identified customer segment to create actionable business insights.
6.  **Visualization:** Generating plots to visualize customer segments and their defining characteristics.
